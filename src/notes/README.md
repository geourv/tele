This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/home/about/ for how to compile this example.



For interactive working on the book execute:
```r
library(bookdown)
serve_book(dir = "./src/practicals", output_dir = "../../docs", preview = TRUE, in_session = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)
```
